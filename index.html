        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p><span class="intro">I'm Rachael Hodson</span>, a lifelong learner, mother of four (you can tell by the grey in my hair and the bags under my eyes), and general creative type.</p>

        <p>I've always loved the humanities — literature! language! art! design! — and finding new ways to express myself. My very left-brained brother was into computers; I grew up thinking that sort of thing was too dull and dry for me. What could ones and zeroes reveal about life's big questions?</p>

        <p>But when a midlife shake-up led me to reevaluate who I am and what I can do, I realized the technologies that let me indulge in my creative interests can be creative outlets, themselves. Coding is language; usable design is art. What's not to love? Turns out technology <em>is</em> for me!</p>

        <p>And so here I am! I've begun a journey with <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush.com</a> to build on the (pretty basic) HTML and CSS skills I already had and explore what other areas of tech might suit me. I hope to eventually work in this field, maybe as a front end developer, putting my creativity to use in practical ways.</p>
